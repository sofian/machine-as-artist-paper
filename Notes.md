# Machine as artist paper

## Main question

If a machine can make art does it mean it is an artist?

In other words: If an entity creates a product (e.g., a painting) that is recognized as an art object, does it entail that that entity is an artist?

## Discussion

Humans *are* machines.

*If* you are human *and* you make art *then* are you an artist? In other words: Is art making a sufficient condition to be considered an artist?

Contemporary art usually defines professional artists as someone who:
1. Is sustainably engaged in a professional artistic career ("I’m an artist if I say so")
2. Presents their work in professional artistic contexts ("It’s art if it’s in an art context")
3. To which I would add: Is recognized by the field as such. (Jon: what do you think?)

See Duchampian definition:
* I’m an artist if I say so.
* It’s art if it’s in an art context.

## Counter-Examples

### Non-artist Humans who Make Art

We can imagine a human who, at some point in their life, created an artwork, yet should not be considered an artist.

#### Example 1: One-hit wonder

We could imagine someone with a non-artistic occupation (e.g., a stay-at-home parent, a lawyer, a construction worker, etc.) who would wake up one morning, create a poem and post it online, which would then drag people's attention and win a prize within a professional poets environment.

Is that person an artist?
* (+) They created an artwork that was shown in an artistic context.
* (-) They do not define themselves as artists.
* (-) They are not pursuing an artistic career.
* (-) They do not have a sustained artistic practice (the "art" kind of "happened" out of the blue, out of context, outside of practice).

#### Example 2: Children

Children are usually not considered artists even if they make art regularly.

Consider for example a child who would paint regularly with a certain talent, and even perhaps display their paintings in a public space such as an office or restaurant.

Is that child an artist?
* (+) They created an artwork that was shown in an artistic context.
* (+) They have a sustained artistic practice.
* (-) They cannot be pursuing an artistic career (because kids are not supposed to work -- at least in Western society).
* (-) They lack the form of agency that society attributes to adults. (This could be contested though...)

#### Example 3: Students

Students in an art or writing class are also not considered artists _per se_ (although some of them might be professional artists).

Consider an art student who has created an artwork that is praised by the whole class.

Are art students artists?
* (+/-) Students are not required to have a sustained artistic practice.
* (-) Students are not required to show their work in professional artistic contexts.
* (-) Students are not required to pursue an artistic career (now and in the future).

#### Example 4: The Unknown Artist

Some artists remain largely unknown their whole life, either by choice or by lack of opportunity. They might create artworks which they only keep in their home, or which they give to friends and family.

Are they artists?
* (+) They have a sustained artistic practice.
* (-) They do not present their work in an artistic context.
* (-) They are not pursuing an artistic career.

Interestingly, some of them might be eventually recognized as artist, maybe even posthumously, if their work is eventually discovered and shown in professional artistic venues.

### Artistic Skills used for Non-Artistic Works

There are many cases where non-artistic works are being produced using artistic skills, often even by persons who are artists.

Examples include advertising, entertainment, but also documentation jobs such as courtroom artists, forensic artists, medical photographers, etc. These people are called "artists" yet what they produce is not called "art".

## Art Made by Non-Artists

### Example 1: Artists Employing Skilled Labor

This is a very common and widely documented example. A person who is employed (or volunteers) by an artist to create part, or whole, of an artwork, is not considered to be an artist.

The distinction is well established in practice and also in law. In practice, what is usually determinant is not who _produced_ the work but who _conceptualized_ the work. In law, it concerns the determination of authorship and intellectual property (laws can vary from country to country).

### Example 2: Monkey Self-Portraits

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute

In a way this example is very similar to one where an artist would be using an algorithm or some other kind of apparatus to produce art. The reason why this example is more ambiguous is perhaps because of the higher attribution of agency that we give to apes. This agency is also clearly what allowed the artist to make the work: if he had left the same kind of situation in a herd of cows, nothing of the sort would have happened.

Interestingly, an analogy could be made here with the children example, especially if we consider child "prodigies". In this case, should the caretakers of the child (who are creating the conditions for the child to create) be attributed some kind of partial (or whole) authorship?

## What about Art Made by Computers?

Can a nonhuman machine be (1) sustainably engaged in a professional artistic practice / career (2) present their work in professional contexts (3) is recognized by the field as an artist.

Condition (2) is the low-hanging fruit: there are plenty of art made by algorithms that are shown in professional contexts. While current-days systems do not put themselves "out-there" on their own, we could presume that it would be possible, in the future, for an algorithm to not only produce art but also autonomously find professional venues where to show it.

Condition (1) is more complicated. ... TO BE CONTINUED

Condition (3)

## Other stuff

Not considered
Duchampian definitions:
I’m an artist if I say so.
It’s art if it’s in an art context.

Turing Test has been "won" by machines emulating art. But could it be won by a machine emulating an artist?

### Artmaking vs Authorship

There exist entities that create products that are recognized as art, yet these entities are not considered the authors of that art. For example: the monkeys who took selfies.

In fact we know that the producers of an art object are not necessarily its authors. Eg. *readymades*, found art, artists who employ other people to create their work.

So there is clearly a dichotomy between authorship and makers/producers.

Question: Does artist = author? (if so, then we have answered our question)

## Creativity vs Creation

Creativity = The capacity or ability to create something.

Creation = The act of creating something.

### Harold Cohen critique of Artificial Creativity

Harold Cohen: Creativity is *relational* (therefore AARON is *not* creative)

Source: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4265294/

Cohen (2010) Cohen H. Orcas, WA Talk given at Orcas Center, Crossroads Lecture Series Driving the creative machine. 2010.

> Creativity… lay in neither the programer alone nor in the program alone, but in the dialog [sic] between program and programer; a dialog resting upon the special and peculiarly intimate relationship that had grown up between us over the years. (Cohen, 2010; p. 9) (note: Cohen had worked 43 years with AARON back in 2010)

> AARON will never make a choice to break the rules, nor will it reflect on those constraints as something that it might want to change… AARON has no sense of continuity or sense of experience from one drawing to the next (Buchanan, 2001) (p. 17).
