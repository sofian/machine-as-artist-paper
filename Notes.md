# Machine as artist paper

Glenn Smith, ed., "The Machine as Artist (for the 21st Century" http://www.mdpi.com/journal/arts/special_issues/Machine_Art#info

## Main question

If a machine can make art does it mean it is an artist?

In other words: If an entity creates a product (e.g., a painting) that is recognized as an art object, does it entail that that entity is an artist?

## Discussion

Humans *are* machines.

*If* you are human *and* you make art *then* are you an artist? In other words: Is art making a sufficient condition to be considered an artist?

## Counter-Examples

### Non-artist Humans who Make Art

We can imagine a human who, at some point in their life, created an artwork, yet should not be considered an artist.

#### Example 1: One-hit wonder

We could imagine someone with a non-artistic occupation (e.g., a stay-at-home parent, a lawyer, a construction worker, etc.) who would wake up one morning, create a poem and post it online, which would then drag people's attention and win a prize within a professional poets environment.

Is that person an artist?

#### Example 2: Children

Children are usually not considered artists even if they make art regularly.

Consider for example a child who would paint regularly with a certain talent, and even perhaps display their paintings in a public space such as an office or restaurant.

Is that child an artist?

#### Example 3: Students

Students in an art or writing class are also not considered artists _per se_ (although some of them might be professional artists).

Consider an art student who has created an artwork that is praised by the whole class.

### Artistic Skills used for Non-Artistic Works

There are many cases where non-artistic works are being produced using artistic skills, often even by persons who are artists.

Examples include advertising, entertainment, but also documentation jobs such as courtroom artists, forensic artists, medical photographers, etc. These people are called "artists" yet what they produce is not called "art".

## Art Made by Non-Artists

### Example 1: Artists Employing Skilled Labor

This is a very common and widely documented example. A person who is employed (or volunteers) by an artist to create part, or whole, of an artwork, is not considered to be an artist.

The distinction is well established in practice and also in law. In practice, what is usually determinant is not who _produced_ the work but who _conceptualized_ the work. In law, it concerns the determination of authorship and intellectual property (laws can vary from country to country).

### Example 2: Monkey Self-Portraits

In a way this example is very similar to one where an artist would be using an algorithm or some other kind of apparatus to produce art. The reason why this example is more ambiguous is perhaps because of the higher attribution of agency that we give to apes. This agency is also clearly what allowed the artist to make the work: if he had left the same kind of situation in a herd of cows, nothing of the sort would have happened.

## Other stuff

Not considered
Duchampian definitions:
I’m an artist if I say so.
It’s art if it’s in an art context.

Turing Test has been "won" by machines emulating art. But could it be won by a machine emulating an artist?

### Artmaking vs Authorship

There exist entities that create products that are recognized as art, yet these entities are not considered the authors of that art. For example: the monkeys who took selfies.

In fact we know that the producers of an art object are not necessarily its authors. Eg. *readymades*, found art, artists who employ other people to create their work.

So there is clearly a dichotomy between authorship and makers/producers.

Question: Does artist = author? (if so, then we have answered our question)

## Creativity vs Creation

Creativity = The capacity or ability to create something.

Creation = The act of creating something.

### Harold Cohen critique of Artificial Creativity

Harold Cohen: Creativity is *relational* (therefore AARON is *not* creative)

Cohen (2010) Cohen H. Orcas, WA Talk given at Orcas Center, Crossroads Lecture Series Driving the creative machine. 2010.

> Creativity… lay in neither the programer alone nor in the program alone, but in the dialog [sic] between program and programer; a dialog resting upon the special and peculiarly intimate relationship that had grown up between us over the years. (Cohen, 2010; p. 9) (note: Cohen had worked 43 years with AARON back in 2010)

> AARON will never make a choice to break the rules, nor will it reflect on those constraints as something that it might want to change… AARON has no sense of continuity or sense of experience from one drawing to the next (Buchanan, 2001) (p. 17).
