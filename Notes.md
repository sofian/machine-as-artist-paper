## Main question

If a machine can make art does it mean it is an artist?

What we are *not* asking: Are machines human?

*If* you are human *and* you make art *then* are you an artist? In other words: Is art making a sufficient condition to be considered an artist?

Monkey self-portraits

Not considered
Duchampian definitions:
I’m an artist if I say so.
It’s art if it’s in an art context.

Turing Test has been "won" by machines emulating art. But could it be won by a machine emulating an artist?

Maybe machines can generate their own aesthetic context?
Follow up questions
Does that mean they’d make art for other machines? Can art be made for non-humans?
Cf. Lynn Hull’s art for animals.
