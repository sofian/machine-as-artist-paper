## Main question

If a machine can make art does it mean it is an artist?

What we are *not* asking: Are machines human?

*If* you are human *and* you make art *then* are you an artist? In other words: Is art making a sufficient condition to be considered an artist?

Monkey self-portraits

Not considered
Duchampian definitions:
I’m an artist if I say so.
It’s art if it’s in an art context.

Turing Test has been "won" by machines emulating art. But could it be won by a machine emulating an artist?

Maybe machines can generate their own aesthetic context?
Follow up questions
Does that mean they’d make art for other machines? Can art be made for non-humans?

### Harold Cohen critique of Artificial Creativity

Harold Cohen: Creativity is *relational* (therefore AARON is *not* creative)

Cohen (2010) Cohen H. Orcas, WA Talk given at Orcas Center, Crossroads Lecture Series Driving the creative machine. 2010.

> Creativity… lay in neither the programer alone nor in the program alone, but in the dialog [sic] between program and programer; a dialog resting upon the special and peculiarly intimate relationship that had grown up between us over the years. (Cohen, 2010; p. 9) (note: Cohen had worked 43 years with AARON back in 2010)

> AARON will never make a choice to break the rules, nor will it reflect on those constraints as something that it might want to change… AARON has no sense of continuity or sense of experience from one drawing to the next (Buchanan, 2001) (p. 17).
